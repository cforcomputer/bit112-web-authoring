        Hi, I am @developuniverse (Patrick O’Brien), I’ve previously worked on various design projects and business strategy outlines such as Evelopedia. I love writing and developing big ideas that could change the face of humanity forever. I have big ambitions and the unwavering optimism to go along with them. I’m not afraid to change the world, and I’ll do everything in my power to do just that. I’m excited to start working as an intern in the near future and should be able to toss in some cool work experience.
        <br>
        <br>
        I’m currently a student at University of Washington. I am working on my first undergraduate degree in Interactive Media Design at the Bothell campus. I plan on minoring in Computer Science and Software Engineering to compliment my design skills.
        <br>
        <br>
        I enjoy reading and creative writing, imagining new worlds and technologies through science fiction is a personal hobby. I got pretty good at digital art and plan on getting back to drawing neat pictures sometime soon, it compliments the whole writing gig pretty well. I’m on a path to expand my understanding of the universe, if you’re reading this, hopefully you enjoy my philosophical ramblings and glean something from their contents.
